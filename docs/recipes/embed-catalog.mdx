# Step 1: Import the code snippet

<CodeGroup>
    ```shell React
    npm i @panora/embedded-card-react
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  By default, all connectors are rendered but you have the option to use the
  `category` prop to filter them by category. Learn more about values accepted
  [here](/glossary/metadata/category).
</Note>

#### Import a single connector card

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript React
    import "@panora/embedded-card-react/dist/index.css";
    import PanoraProviderCard from "@panora/embedded-card-react";

    const MyPage = () => {
        return (
            <PanoraProviderCard
                name={"hubspot"} # name of the provider
                category={"crm"} # vertical where provider belongs to
                projectId={"c9a1b1f8-466d-442d-a95e-11cdd00baf49"} # the project id tied to your organization
                returnUrl={"https://acme.inc"} # the url you want to redirect users to after the connection flow is successful
                linkedUserId={"b860d6c1-28f9-485c-86cd-fb09e60f10a2"}  # the linked id of the user if already created in Panora system or user's info in your system
            />
        )
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>
#### Import the whole connector catalog
<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript React
    import "@panora/embedded-card-react/dist/index.css";
    import PanoraDynamicCatalog from "@panora/embedded-card-react";

    const MyPage = () => {
        return (
            <PanoraDynamicCatalog
                category={"crm"} # optional but if provided it returns only connectors of the category
                projectId={"c9a1b1f8-466d-442d-a95e-11cdd00baf49"} # the project id tied to your organization
                returnUrl={"https://acme.inc"} # the url you want to redirect users to after the connection flow is successful
                linkedUserId={"b860d6c1-28f9-485c-86cd-fb09e60f10a2"}  # the linked id of the user if already created in Panora system or user's info in your system
            />
        )
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>

Congrats ! You should be able to see the displayed connectors !

# Step 2 (optional): Select your own connectors
 
**insert**video

You have the ability to choose which connectors will be rendered (also applied to magic-link).

Go to _Manage Catalog Widget_ [section](https://dashboard.panora.dev/configuration), locate the connector you wish to add/remove and switch it on/off.
