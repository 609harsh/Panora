## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Panora Running on your machine** (⏱️ 1 min self-hosting guide [here](/open-source/self_hosting/guide))
- **An API key** (⏱️ 1 min guide guide [here](/core-concepts/auth#learn-how-to-generate-your-api-keys))
- **A free Hubspot account** (signup [here](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/crm) - use a [disposable email](https://temp-mail.org/en/) if you prefer)

## **Step 1: Getting access to your users data**

There are two ways for a user to grant you access to their data: 
- [**No-code: Magic Links**](/core-concepts/magic-links)  
- [**Natively embedding into frontend**](/recipes/embed-catalog).

Magic Links help you invite your users to grant you access to their data without a dedicated website. 
Let's now create our first magic link!


    <Steps>
      <Step>Login to your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.panora.dev)</Step>
      <Step>
        Go to _Connections_ [section](https://dashboard.panora.dev/connections) and click button `Create a Magic Link`
      </Step>
      <Step>Click `Create a Unique Magic Link`</Step>
      <Step>
        You'll be asked for two informations: an `Origin User Email` (of the user
        you're creating the link for) and an `Origin User Identifier`. The `Origin
        User Identifier` is the id of the user you're inviting, as represented in your
        sofwtare. If you already have created a [Linked User](/recipes/import-existing-users) you have the option to select
        it.
      </Step>
      <Step>Click `Generate`</Step>
    </Steps>


Once the user successfully completes the granting auth flow, the connection will have a `status` value of `valid`.

## Step 2: Grab the connection token

Connection tokens are the way Panora represents a third party's account, whatever the underlying identification mechanism is.
There are two ways to get these tokens: catchting them with a webhook, or just finding them in your dashboard. For now, we'll stick to the dashboard,.

Let's find the `connection token` in the dashboard.

## **Step 3: Make your first  API requests**

Let's Create a contact in our Hubspot acccount, using Panora's API.

This will require you to have: 
- The `connection token` from the previous step
- An API key (guide [here](/core-concepts/auth#learn-how-to-generate-your-api-keys))

The API key identifies _YOU_ as a user of Panora, while the connection token identifies which user's account you behalf you want to. In the future, you will have one connection token per user account connected on the Panora platform, while keeping one API key.


      In this example, we will create a contact in a CRM. Visit other sections of the [documentation](/api-reference/introduction) to find category-specific examples.
      <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript TypeScript
        import { Panora } from "@panora/sdk";

        const panora = new Panora({
          apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
        });

        const input = {
            first_name: 'tom',
            last_name: 'jedusor',
            email_addresses: [
              {
                'email_address': 'tom@jedusor.com',
                'email_address_type': 'PERSONAL'
              }
            ],
            phone_numbers: [
              {
                'phone_number': '+33650438278',
                'phone_type': 'MOBILE'
              }
            ],
        };

        const result = await panora.crm.contacts.create({
          xConnectionToken: "YOUR_USER_CONNECTION_TOKEN",
          unifiedCrmContactInput: input,
        });

        console.log(result);
        ```

        ```python Python
        import os
        from panora_sdk import Panora

        panora = Panora(
          api_key=os.getenv("API_KEY", ""),
        )

        body = {
          'first_name': 'tom',
          'last_name': 'jedusor',
          'email_addresses': [
            {
              'email_address': 'tom@jedusor.com',
              'email_address_type': 'PERSONAL'
            }
          ],
          'phone_numbers': [
            {
              'phone_number': '+33650438278',
              'phone_type': 'MOBILE'
            }
          ]
        }

        res = panora.crm.contacts.create(x_connection_token="YOUR_USER_CONNECTION_TOKEN", unified_crm_contact_input=body)

        print(res)
        ```

        ```shell curl
        curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.panora.dev/crm/contacts \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
        --header 'x-connection-token: <MY_USER_CONNECTION_TOKEN>' \
        --data '{
            "first_name": "tom",
            "last_name": "jedusor",
            "email_addresses": [
              {
                "email_address": "tom@jedusor.com",
                "email_address_type": "PERSONAL"
              }
            ],
            "phone_numbers": [
              {
                "phone_number": "+33650438278",
                "phone_type": "MOBILE"
              }
            ]
          }'
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

Let’s break down what’s happening here:

- We import the `Panora` sdk, which provides a convenient way to interact with the Panora Unified API.
- We create an instance of the `Panora` client, passing in our API key.
- We call the `panora.crm.contacts.create` method to add a contact inside a 3rd party. We specify the input we want to use (see [here](/crm/contacts/overview) for reference).
- We pass the connection token catched during step 1 ([More info here](/core-concepts/auth#catch-connection-tokens))
- Finally, we print the response.

## Suggested Next Steps

Amazing! You’ve successfully sent your first unified API request with Panora! Here are some next steps to continue your learning journey:

- Setup your first [webhooks](/webhooks/overview)

API resources:
Check our [API documentation](/api-reference/introduction) for more details on the available endpoints and parameters.

Check our SDKs: [Typescript](/backend-sdk/typescript) for a set of tools to make it easier for you to build with and integrate Panora into your applications.
