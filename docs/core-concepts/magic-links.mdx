## Send your first Magic Link

<Steps>

<Step>Login to your account dashboard</Step>

<Step>Go to section _Connections_ and local button `Create a Magic Link`</Step>

<Step>Click `Create a Unique Magic Link`</Step>

<Step>
  You'll be asked for two informations: an `Origin User Email` and an `Origin
  User Identifier`. The `Origin User Identifier` is the id of the user you're
  inviting, as represented in your systems.
</Step>

<Step>Click `Generate`. You can now share the link!</Step>

</Steps>

Once the user successfully completes the granting auth flow, the connection will have a `status` value of `valid`.
We recommend listening to [webhooks](/webhooks/overview) to get notified once a user connects.
