## Overview

Creating a `Field Mapping` involves two majors actions:

- Defining a custom field on Panora's side
- Mapping it to a field from your customer's software.

<Steps>

    <Step title="Login to your Dashboard">
    Login to your account dashboard and click on _Configuration_ section and go to tab **Field Mapping**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define your custom field">
    Click `Add Field Mapping`. Select a unified object you want to extend, and give your custom field a slug and a friendly name. You also need to select a data type.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Map your custom field to a remote field">

Now, move to the `Map Fields` section. To finish the mapping, select the custom field you just created, and fill the fields `Provider` and Linked User ID.

</Step>

    <Step>

You will now find all the fields your user has in its software. Pick the one that you want to map to.

</Step>
