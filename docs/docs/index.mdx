Panora is an Open Source iPaaS that provides unified APIs, tailored to your business needs.

Our product makes it quick and easy for SaaS teams to ship customer-facing integrations between their product and others.

We do so by providing a single API that abstracts similar tools your customer may use along your product behind a common data model.

## Getting started

There are three ways for you to get started with Panora:

- **Cloud:** The fastest and easiest way to try the app (it's free)
- **Local:** If you're a developer and would like to experiment or contribute to the app
- **Self-hosting:** If you want greater control over your data and want to run the app on your own server

See our [Getting Started](./start/getting-started/) guide to learn more.

## Contributing

Contributions are what makes the open source community such an amazing place.

Code contributions through pull request are most welcome. See our [local setup guide](../contribute/local-setup) to get started.
