## Send your first Magic Link

<Steps>

<Step>Login to your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.panora.dev)</Step>

<Step>
  Go to the _Connections_ [section](https://dashboard.panora.dev/connections)
  and click button `Create a Magic Link`
</Step>

<Step>Click `Create a Unique Magic Link`</Step>

<Step>
  You'll be asked for two informations: an `Origin User Email` and an `Origin
  User Identifier`. The `Origin User Identifier` is the id of the user you're
  inviting, as represented in your systems. If you already have created a
  [Linked User](/recipes/import-existing-users) you have the option to select
  it.
</Step>

<Step>Click `Generate`</Step>

</Steps>

Once the user successfully completes the granting auth flow, the connection will have a `status` value of `valid`.
We recommend listening to [webhooks](/webhooks/overview) to get notified once a user connects and catch the connection token used for requests.
