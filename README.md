Our product makes it quick and easy for SaaS teams to ship customer-facing integrations between their product and others.

We do so by providing a single API that abstracts similar tools your customer may use along your product behind a common data model.

This way, you can write one code to push data anywhere!

# 💻  Try Self-hosted

## Requirements

 1. Install Docker on your machine.
 2. Make sure Docker Compose is installed and available (it should be the case if you have chosen to install Docker via Docker Desktop).
 3. Make sure Git is installed on your machine.

## Run the app

 1. Get the code

```
  git clone https://github.com/panoratech/Panora.git
 ```

 2. Go to Panora folder

```
  cd panora
  ```

 3. Start

```
  docker compose --env-file ./.env.example up
 ```

You can now open your browser and go to <http://localhost> to connect to the application. Panora's API is exposed at <http://localhost:3000>.
