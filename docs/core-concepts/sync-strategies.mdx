## Periodic Sync
Unfortunately, webhooks aren’t always available. Many Third Party applications don’t support real time events. But rest assured, Panora has you covered! With our robust polling technology, our servers will automatically check for new records created/updated and proxy those changes to your application in near real-time.

## Real Time Webhooks

### Auto-configure Webhooks

### Configure webhooks for aggregation
