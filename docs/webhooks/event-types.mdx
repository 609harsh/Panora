## The *event* Object
The `event` object is used to represent an existing change to an object.
The typical implementation consists in listening for events and triggering worklows in your backend based on the content of the field **type** and data of the webhook.

### Properties

<RequestExample>

## Securing your webhooks 
We use secrets to make sure your endpoints do not receive data from third-parties usurpating Panora.

## Event Type List
This is a list of all the types of events we currently send. We may add more at any time, so in developing and maintaining your code, you should not assume that only these types exist.

You’ll notice that these events follow a pattern: resource.event. Our goal is to design a consistent system that makes things easier to anticipate and code against. Events that occur on subresources like customer.subscription do not trigger the parent’s update event.
