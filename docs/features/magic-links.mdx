## Send your first Magic Link

<Steps>

<Step>
Login to your account dashboard
</Step>

<Step>
Go to section Connections and local button `Create a Magic Link`
</Step>

<Step>
Click `Create a Unique Magic Link` 
</Step>

<Step>
You'll be asked for two informations: an email and an `Origin User Identifier`.
The `Origin User Identifier` is the id of the user you're inviting, as represented in your systems.

The connection will show as `status` until the user connects to a platform.
We recommend listening to webhooks to get notified once a user connects.
