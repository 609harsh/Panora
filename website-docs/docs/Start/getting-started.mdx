There are three ways for you to get started with Panora:

### 1. Cloud

The easiest way to quickly try the app is to signup on [panora.dev](https://panora.dev/).

The signup is free.

### 2. Local

If you're a developer and would like to experiment or contribute to the app, you can install Panora on your local environment. Follow our [local setup](/contribute/local-setup) guide to get started.

### 3. Self-hosting

We provide [self-hosting options](/start/self-hosted) if you want greater control over your data and want to run the app on your own server.
